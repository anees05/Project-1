## Overview
Event Hunter is an app that uses Ticketmaster and Google Maps to search for events and display additional information about them. There is even a day/night color scheme included!
## How to Use It
Search for any event you're interested in in the search bar at the top of the page. You can click on any of the results to view more information about the event, such as:
 - The event's date, time, and location
 - The expected weather for that date
 - A view of the location in google maps
 - A link to purchase tickets
 - Any additional disclaimers or information about the event
## Development
This app was developed using HTML, SASS/SCSS, JavaScript, and jQuery + AJAX. We also used the Ticketmaster and Google Maps APIs.
